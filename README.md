calparks-django
===============
Django application for user recommendation for California State Parks. Think of this as Yelp for California
state park.

This application is posted on github more to demonstrate my ability to code in django, javascript.

I have been doing programming professionally for 20+ years, but just recently 9 months (as of June 2013) have been 
programming using django, javascript etc.

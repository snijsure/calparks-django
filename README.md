calparks-django
===============
Django application for user recommendation for California State Parks. 

This application is posted on github more to demonstrate my ability to code in django, javascript,python

You can see screen shots in https://github.com/snijsure/calparks-django/tree/master/screen-shots

These days people love to see sample, more over they want to see open source contributions, while
there are many employers that encourage open source contribution, alas majority still don't.


In order to run this application you will have to do the following:

python manage.py migrate
python manage.py createsuperuser
python manage.py makemigrations calparks
python manage.py runserver
